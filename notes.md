### Questions to ask yourself

#### How code should be written

_The code you write should meet two often-contradictory goals. It must remain concrete enough to
be understood while simultaneously being abstract enough to allow for change._


1. How difficult was it to write?
 
2. How hard is it to understand?

3. How expensive will it be to change?




### Flocking Rules

1. Select the things that are most alike.
2. Find the smallest difference between them.
3. Make the simplest change that will remove that difference.
Changes to code can be subdivided into four distinct steps:
1. parse the new code
2. parse and execute it
